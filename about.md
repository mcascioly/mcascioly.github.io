Welcome!

This is the official website for the Division C Science Olympiad Team of the Middlesex County Academy for Science, Mathematics, and Engineering Technologies. General information, updates, pictures, and sponsors will all be featured here.

Science Olympiad is a non-profit organization with the mission of “improving the quality of K-12 science education, increasing male, female and minority interest in science, creating a technologically-literate workforce and providing recognition for outstanding achievement by both students and teachers”. 

Like a sports team, Science Olympiad requires preparation, resources, commitment, coaching and lots of practice from its members throughout the year. The 23 events in which students can compete in at local and national competitions range from astronomy to herpetology to fossils to genetics. 

For any questions, feel free to email us at <sciolymca@gmail.com>!
